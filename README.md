# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (React)

## üéÆ Description:
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **React**. The app allows two players to challenge each other in the classic game, trying to align three symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

This project was created to practice **state management** in React and component composition. Through this exercise, I learned how to manage the data flow within the app and how to react to user interactions using **local state** within each component.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   If you haven't already, start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-react.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe-react
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   To start the project in development mode, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server, and the app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üß† What I Learned:
- Managing **state** in React.
- Creating **components** and managing **props**.
- Using **event handlers** to manage user interactions (clicking the game squares).
- Implementing game logic to determine if a player has won or if the game ended in a draw.
  
## üöÄ Features:
- **2 players** (X and O) can take turns playing.
- The game automatically detects if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- You can **reset the game** and start a new match.
